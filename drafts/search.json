Scale compares the size of lengths on a map to those in the real landscape.\nKey Concept: If a map has a scale of 1:50,000, this means that 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm (or 500 m) in real life.\n\n\nA map has a scale of 1:25,000.\n\nIf two towns are 3 cm apart on the map, how far apart are they in real life?\n\nSolution: - Map distance = 3 cm - Real distance = 3 × 25,000 = 75,000 cm = 750 m = 0.75 km\n\nIf two landmarks are 2 km apart in real life, how far apart would they be on the map?\n\nSolution: - Real distance = 2 km = 200,000 cm - Map distance = 200,000 ÷ 25,000 = 8 cm\n\n\n\n\nCartesian coordinates refer to the location of a specific point using a combination of horizontal distance and vertical distance.\nExample: The star below is located at (7, 4).\n[Imagine a coordinate grid with x-axis from 0 to 9 and y-axis from 0 to 6. A star is plotted at the point where x=7 and y=4.]\n\n\n\nLongitude is the number of degrees ‘around the world’ from the Prime Meridian\nLatitude is measured in degrees north or south from the equator\n\n\n\n\nOn a map with a grid system: - Location A is at grid reference (345, 678) - Location B is at grid reference (348, 682)\nIf each grid unit represents 100 meters, how far apart are A and B?\nSolution: Using the distance formula: \\[d = \\sqrt{(348-345)^2 + (682-678)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ grid units}\\]\nReal distance = 5 × 100 = 500 meters\n\n\n\n\nPolar coordinates specify a location using the angle or bearing from a given point and the distance from that point.\nBearings are measured clockwise from North and are written as three-digit numbers: - North = 000° (or 360°) - East = 090° - South = 180° - West = 270°\n\n\nFrom point A, a landmark is located on a bearing of 045° at a distance of 3 km.\n\nIn which general direction is the landmark?\n\nSolution: 045° is halfway between North (000°) and East (090°), so it’s Northeast.\n\nIf you walk on a bearing of 045° for 3 km, how far East and North have you traveled?\n\nSolution: Using trigonometry: - East component = 3 × sin(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km - North component = 3 × cos(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a map of your local area:\n\nIdentify your school on the map\nMeasure the distance from your school to a local landmark\nUse the map scale to calculate the real distance\nRecord the grid reference or coordinates of both locations\n\n\n\n\nCreate a treasure map with: - A coordinate grid system - At least 5 landmarks marked with coordinates - Write instructions using coordinates to move from one landmark to another\n\n\n\nUsing a compass or compass app:\n\nStand at a starting point\nFollow these instructions:\n\nWalk 20 paces on bearing 090°\nWalk 15 paces on bearing 180°\nWalk 20 paces on bearing 270°\nWalk 15 paces on bearing 000°\n\nWhere should you end up? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nTe Reo Māori\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\nAhopae\n\n\nLongitude\nAhopou\n\n\nMap\nMahere\n\n\nScale drawing\nTuhinga āwhata\n\n\nScale\nĀwhata\n\n\nCartesian coordinates\nTaunga tukutuku\n\n\nNorth\nRaki\n\n\nSouth\nRunga\n\n\nEast\nRāwhiti\n\n\nWest\nRātō\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipuna (Ancestors) had clever ways to navigate in the absence of sophisticated GPS systems. Polynesian navigators used:\n\nOcean currents\nThe sun and stars\nThe migration of whales and birds\nWave patterns and swells\n\nThese traditional methods allowed Pacific peoples to travel vast distances across the ocean with remarkable accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map has a scale of 1:50,000. What real distance does 4.5 cm on the map represent?\nTwo cities are 150 km apart. How far apart would they be on a map with a scale of 1:1,000,000?\nOn a treasure map, the scale is 1 cm = 5 m. If the treasure is 7.5 cm from the starting point on the map, how far is it in real life?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the following locations on a coordinate grid:\n\nSchool: (2, 5)\nLibrary: (7, 5)\nPark: (2, 1)\nShop: (7, 1)\n\nUsing your plotted points from question 4, calculate the distance from:\n\nSchool to Library\nSchool to Park\nLibrary to Shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your starting position:\n\nPoint A is on a bearing of 045° at 5 km\nPoint B is on a bearing of 135° at 5 km\nPoint C is on a bearing of 225° at 5 km\nPoint D is on a bearing of 315° at 5 km\n\nSketch these points. What shape do they form?\nYou walk 3 km on a bearing of 060°. How far North and how far East have you traveled?\nTo get from home to school, you walk 400 m East then 300 m North.\n\nWhat is the direct distance from home to school?\nWhat bearing would take you directly from home to school?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Carpet Journey: Plan a journey from your location to a Pacific Island nation. Provide:\n\nStarting and ending coordinates (latitude/longitude)\nBearing from start to finish\nDistance of the journey\n\nMultiple Navigation: Starting from point A, follow these instructions:\n\n5 km on bearing 030°\n3 km on bearing 120°\n4 km on bearing 210°\n\nCalculate your final position relative to point A using coordinates.\nMap Making Project: Create a detailed scale map of your school grounds including:\n\nA clear scale\nGrid reference system\nAll major buildings and landmarks\nCompass rose showing North\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using: - Google Maps for exploring scale and real-world coordinates - Compass apps on mobile phones for practicing bearings - GPS tracking apps to see how movement in real life corresponds to movement on a map - Online mapping tools to create custom maps with coordinate grids\n\n\n\nStudents could demonstrate their understanding by:\n\nCreating a detailed treasure map with scale, coordinates, and bearing-based instructions\nPlanning and executing a navigation course using bearings and distances\nConverting between map distances and real distances using various scales\nUsing latitude and longitude to identify locations around New Zealand and the Pacific\n\n\n\n\nLetter to Parents and Whānau:\nThis week in maths, we are learning about maps. We’re exploring how maps use mathematics including: - Scale (to show big places on small maps) - Coordinates (to locate specific places) - Bearings (to give directions)\nYou can help by: - Looking at maps together at home (road maps, street directories, online maps) - Asking your child to explain how the scale works - Having them show you how to describe where things are using coordinates - Discussing how GPS and digital maps work\nIf you have any paper maps at home, ask your child to show you the important parts and demonstrate how to describe locations and give directions using the map.\n\n\n\n\nCompasses (for finding north, not for drawing circles) or phones with compass app\nProtractors\nRulers\nPencils and paper\nMaps of local area or access to online maps\nCalculator (for trigonometry in bearing calculations)\n\n\n\n\nBy completing this lesson, students will have developed skills in: - Mathematical thinking: Understanding scale relationships and coordinate systems - Problem solving: Converting between map and real distances - Communication: Using mathematical language to describe locations and directions - Cultural awareness: Appreciating traditional navigation methods of Pacific peoples - Practical application: Using mathematical concepts in real-world contexts\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to understand map scales?\nHow do coordinates help us communicate locations precisely?\nWhat are the advantages of using bearings instead of just saying “go northeast”?\nHow do digital maps like Google Maps use these mathematical concepts?\nWhat can we learn from traditional Polynesian navigation methods?\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the connection between the Pythagorean theorem and the distance formula\nApply the distance formula to calculate the distance between any two points\nSimplify radical expressions in distance calculations\nSolve real-world problems involving distance on coordinate planes\nFind unknown coordinates when given distance information\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important applications of coordinate geometry is finding the distance between two points. Whether you’re calculating how far apart two cities are on a map, finding the straight-line distance a delivery drone needs to travel, or determining if two locations are within wireless signal range, the distance formula is essential.\n\n\n\nBefore we explore the distance formula, let’s recall the Pythagorean theorem:\nFor a right triangle with legs of length \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and hypotenuse of length \\(c\\):\n\\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\]\nExample: If a right triangle has legs of 3 and 4 units, find the hypotenuse.\n\\[c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\\] \\[c = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\]\n\n\n\nWhen we plot two points on a coordinate plane, we can create a right triangle:\nConsider points A\\((x_1, y_1)\\) and B\\((x_2, y_2)\\): - The horizontal leg has length \\(|x_2 - x_1|\\) - The vertical leg has length \\(|y_2 - y_1|\\) - The distance between A and B is the hypotenuse\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: \\[d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\nThis is the distance formula.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the distance between points A(1, 2) and B(4, 6).\nSolution: Identify the coordinates: \\((x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2) = (4, 6)\\)\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{9 + 16}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\]\nThe distance is exactly 5 units.\n\n\n\nFind the distance between C(-2, 3) and D(4, -1).\nSolution: \\[d = \\sqrt{(4-(-2))^2 + (-1-3)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{(4+2)^2 + (-4)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{6^2 + 16}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{36 + 16}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{52}\\]\nTo simplify: \\(\\sqrt{52} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 13} = 2\\sqrt{13}\\)\nApproximately: \\(d \\approx 7.21\\) units\n\n\n\nFind the distance between E(2, 5) and F(2, 9).\nSolution: \\[d = \\sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (9-5)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{0 + 4^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{16} = 4\\]\nNote: When points share the same x-coordinate (vertical line) or y-coordinate (horizontal line), the distance is simply the difference in the other coordinate.\n\n\n\nFind the distance from the origin O(0, 0) to point P(6, 8).\nSolution: \\[d = \\sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (8-0)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{36 + 64}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\]\nThe distance from the origin to any point \\((x, y)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\n\n\n\nWhen the distance is not a perfect square, we should simplify:\n\n\nFind the distance between G(-1, 2) and H(5, 4), leaving your answer in simplest radical form.\nSolution: \\[d = \\sqrt{(5-(-1))^2 + (4-2)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{36 + 4}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{40}\\]\nFactor out perfect squares: \\(\\sqrt{40} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10} = 2\\sqrt{10}\\)\nDecimal approximation: \\(d \\approx 6.32\\) units\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA park ranger at point P(2, 5) needs to reach a hiker in distress at point H(8, 13). Each coordinate unit represents 100 meters. How far must the ranger travel in a straight line?\nSolution: \\[d = \\sqrt{(8-2)^2 + (13-5)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{36 + 64}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ units}\\]\nReal distance = 10 × 100 = 1000 meters = 1 km\n\n\n\nA cell tower is located at coordinates (3, 4) and has a signal range of 10 km. A house is located at (11, 10). Is the house within range? (Units are in kilometers)\nSolution: Distance from tower to house: \\[d = \\sqrt{(11-3)^2 + (10-4)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{64 + 36}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ km}\\]\nThe house is exactly at the edge of the signal range (10 km).\n\n\n\nA delivery company needs to determine which warehouse is closer to a customer. - Warehouse A is at (2, 3) - Warehouse B is at (-1, 7) - Customer is at (5, 6)\nWhich warehouse should make the delivery?\nSolution:\nDistance from A to Customer: \\[d_A = \\sqrt{(5-2)^2 + (6-3)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4.24\\]\nDistance from B to Customer: \\[d_B = \\sqrt{(5-(-1))^2 + (6-7)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 1} = \\sqrt{37} \\approx 6.08\\]\nWarehouse A is closer (4.24 units vs 6.08 units).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint A is at (3, 4) and point B is at (x, 10). The distance between them is 10 units. Find all possible values of x.\nSolution: \\[10 = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (10-4)^2}\\] \\[10 = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + 36}\\]\nSquare both sides: \\[100 = (x-3)^2 + 36\\] \\[(x-3)^2 = 64\\] \\[x - 3 = \\pm 8\\]\nTherefore: \\(x = 3 + 8 = 11\\) or \\(x = 3 - 8 = -5\\)\nAnswer: B could be at (11, 10) or (-5, 10).\n\n\n\nPoints P(2, y) and Q(6, 3) are 5 units apart. Find y.\nSolution: \\[5 = \\sqrt{(6-2)^2 + (3-y)^2}\\] \\[5 = \\sqrt{16 + (3-y)^2}\\] \\[25 = 16 + (3-y)^2\\] \\[(3-y)^2 = 9\\] \\[3 - y = \\pm 3\\]\nTherefore: \\(y = 3 - 3 = 0\\) or \\(y = 3 + 3 = 6\\)\nAnswer: P could be at (2, 0) or (2, 6).\n\n\n\n\nRemember from Lesson 2 that maps use scales. When using the distance formula with map coordinates, don’t forget to convert to real distances:\nExample 11: On a map with scale 1:50,000, two landmarks are at grid coordinates (120, 80) and (180, 140). Each grid unit represents 1 meter. What is the real distance between the landmarks?\nSolution: Map distance (in grid units): \\[d = \\sqrt{(180-120)^2 + (140-80)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{60^2 + 60^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{3600 + 3600}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{7200} = 60\\sqrt{2} \\approx 84.85 \\text{ grid units}\\]\nSince each unit = 1 meter, map distance = 84.85 m\nReal distance = 84.85 m × scale = 84.85 × 1 = 84.85 m (the scale tells us about map:real ratio, but here we’re working with grid units that are already scaled)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the distance between:\n\nA(0, 0) and B(5, 12)\nC(2, 3) and D(8, 11)\nE(-4, 1) and F(2, -7)\nG(-3, -2) and H(-7, -5)\n\nSimplify your answers in simplest radical form:\n\nDistance between (0, 0) and (3, 7)\nDistance between (1, 2) and (6, 5)\nDistance between (-2, 3) and (4, 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the distance between:\n\nTwo points on a horizontal line: (2, 5) and (9, 5)\nTwo points on a vertical line: (3, 1) and (3, 8)\nTwo points where one is the origin: (0, 0) and (-6, -8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA drone flies from point A(10, 20) to point B(40, 50).

Find the coordinates of the fourth vertex D and verify your answer by showing all four sides have equal length.\nProve that the triangle with vertices A(0, 0), B(4, 0), and C(2, 2√3) is equilateral by showing all three sides have the same length.\nA lighthouse at position (0, 0) has a light that can be seen up to 20 km away. A ship is traveling in a straight line from point (-15, 20) to point (25, 15). Will the ship be visible from the lighthouse at any point during its journey? (Hint: Find the closest point on the path to the lighthouse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse graphing calculators or Desmos to visualize distances\nGeoGebra has excellent tools for exploring coordinate geometry\nGoogle Earth for real-world distance applications\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for “distance formula derivation” to see animated proofs\n“Pythagorean theorem applications” shows real-world uses\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Distance Formula: For three dimensions: \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}\\)\nTaxicab Distance: In cities with grid layouts, you can’t travel “as the crow flies”\nGPS and Great Circle Distance: How GPS calculates distance on the curved Earth\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Practice Exercises Sets 1 and 2 completely, and at least 3 problems from Set 3.\nFor additional practice, see the Resources section.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\nApply the midpoint formula to find the center point of a line segment\nUnderstand midpoint as the average of coordinates\nUse midpoints to solve geometric problems\nFind unknown endpoints when given a midpoint\nApply midpoint concepts to real-world situations\n\n\n\n\nThe midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides it into two equal parts - exactly halfway between the two endpoints. This concept is crucial in many applications: finding the center of a bridge, determining meeting points, locating optimal facility placements, and solving geometric problems.\n\n\n\nFor a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), the midpoint M is:\n\\[ M = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right) \\]\n\n\nThe midpoint formula simply takes the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates: - Midpoint x-coordinate: \\(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\\) - Midpoint y-coordinate: \\(\\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\)\nThink of it as finding the “balance point” between two locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the midpoint of the line segment joining A(2, 3) and B(8, 7).\nSolution: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{2 + 8}{2}, \\frac{3 + 7}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = \\left(\\frac{10}{2}, \\frac{10}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = (5, 5)\\]\nThe midpoint is at (5, 5).\n\n\n\nFind the midpoint of the line segment joining P(-4, 6) and Q(2, -2).\nSolution: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{-4 + 2}{2}, \\frac{6 + (-2)}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = \\left(\\frac{-2}{2}, \\frac{4}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = (-1, 2)\\]\n\n\n\nFind the midpoint of the line segment joining O(0, 0) and R(10, 6).\nSolution: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{0 + 10}{2}, \\frac{0 + 6}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = (5, 3)\\]\nNote: The midpoint between the origin and any point \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n\n\nFind the midpoint of S(1.5, 2.5) and T(4.5, 6.5).\nSolution: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{1.5 + 4.5}{2}, \\frac{2.5 + 6.5}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = \\left(\\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{9}{2}\\right)\\] \\[M = (3, 4.5)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo friends live at coordinates A(2, 8) and B(10, 4).

Find the point Q that is symmetric to P with respect to the origin (0, 0).\nSolution:\nIf the origin is the midpoint between P and Q, then:\nLet Q = \\((x, y)\\)\n\\[\\frac{3 + x}{2} = 0 \\text{ and } \\frac{5 + y}{2} = 0\\]\n\\[x = -3 \\text{ and } y = -5\\]\nPoint Q is at (-3, -5).\nThis is reflection through the origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints A(0, 0) and B(9, 6) are the endpoints of a segment. Find two points that divide the segment into three equal parts.\nSolution:\nFirst, find the midpoint M of AB: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{0+9}{2}, \\frac{0+6}{2}\\right) = (4.5, 3)\\]\nNow find the midpoint of AM: \\[P = \\left(\\frac{0+4.5}{2}, \\frac{0+3}{2}\\right) = (2.25, 1.5)\\]\nAnd the midpoint of MB: \\[Q = \\left(\\frac{4.5+9}{2}, \\frac{3+6}{2}\\right) = (6.75, 4.5)\\]\nHowever, this doesn’t trisect. To trisect, we need: - First point at 1/3 of the way: \\((x_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(x_2-x_1), y_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(y_2-y_1)) = (3, 2)\\) - Second point at 2/3 of the way: \\((x_1 + \\frac{2}{3}(x_2-x_1), y_1 + \\frac{2}{3}(y_2-y_1)) = (6, 4)\\)\nThe two trisection points are (3, 2) and (6, 4).\n\n\n\nA triangle has vertices at A(0, 0), B(6, 0), and C(3, 6).

The center lies on the perpendicular bisector of any chord. Find an approximation of the center.\nSolution:\nFind midpoint of AB: \\[M_{AB} = \\left(\\frac{0+4}{2}, \\frac{4+0}{2}\\right) = (2, 2)\\]\nThe center is somewhere on the perpendicular bisector through (2, 2).\nFind midpoint of AC: \\[M_{AC} = \\left(\\frac{0+0}{2}, \\frac{4+(-4)}{2}\\right) = (0, 0)\\]\nThis suggests the center might be near the origin. By symmetry with points A and C, the center is at (0, 0) and the radius is 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two endpoints are equidistant from the midpoint:\nExample 16: Verify that M(4, 5) is equidistant from A(1, 2) and B(7, 8).\nDistance from M to A: \\[d_{MA} = \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\]\nDistance from M to B: \\[d_{MB} = \\sqrt{(7-4)^2 + (8-5)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\]\nBoth distances equal \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\), confirming M is the midpoint.\n\n\n\nExample 17: On a map with scale 1:10,000, two landmarks are at (240, 180) and (360, 260). Each unit represents 10 meters. Where should a information sign be placed at the midpoint?\nSolution: \\[M = \\left(\\frac{240+360}{2}, \\frac{180+260}{2}\\right) = (300, 220)\\]\nThe sign should be at grid position (300, 220).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the midpoint of the line segment joining:\n\nA(4, 6) and B(10, 12)\nC(-2, 5) and D(6, -3)\nE(0, 8) and F(8, 0)\nG(-5, -7) and H(-1, -3)\n\nFind the midpoint between:\n\nThe origin and (12, 16)\n(3.5, 7.2) and (8.5, 4.8)\n\\((-\\frac{1}{2}, 3)\\) and \\((\\frac{5}{2}, 7)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe midpoint of segment PQ is M(6, 4). If P is at (2, 1), find Q.\nThe midpoint of segment RS is M(-3, 5). If S is at (1, 9), find R.\nPoint A(5, 8) is one endpoint. The midpoint is M(3, 4).

Scale compares the size of lengths on a map to those in the real landscape.\nKey Concept: If a map has a scale of 1:50,000, this means that 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm (or 500 m) in real life.\n\n\nA map has a scale of 1:25,000.\n\nIf two towns are 3 cm apart on the map, how far apart are they in real life?\n\nSolution: - Map distance = 3 cm - Real distance = 3 × 25,000 = 75,000 cm = 750 m = 0.75 km\n\nIf two landmarks are 2 km apart in real life, how far apart would they be on the map?\n\nSolution: - Real distance = 2 km = 200,000 cm - Map distance = 200,000 ÷ 25,000 = 8 cm\n\n\n\n\nCartesian coordinates refer to the location of a specific point using a combination of horizontal distance and vertical distance.\nExample: The star below is located at (7, 4).\n[Imagine a coordinate grid with x-axis from 0 to 9 and y-axis from 0 to 6. A star is plotted at the point where x=7 and y=4.]\n\n\n\nLongitude is the number of degrees ‘around the world’ from the Prime Meridian\nLatitude is measured in degrees north or south from the equator\n\n\n\n\nOn a map with a grid system: - Location A is at grid reference (345, 678) - Location B is at grid reference (348, 682)\nIf each grid unit represents 100 meters, how far apart are A and B?\nSolution: Using the distance formula: \\[d = \\sqrt{(348-345)^2 + (682-678)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ grid units}\\]\nReal distance = 5 × 100 = 500 meters\n\n\n\n\nPolar coordinates specify a location using the angle or bearing from a given point and the distance from that point.\nBearings are measured clockwise from North and are written as three-digit numbers: - North = 000° (or 360°) - East = 090° - South = 180° - West = 270°\n\n\nFrom point A, a landmark is located on a bearing of 045° at a distance of 3 km.\n\nIn which general direction is the landmark?\n\nSolution: 045° is halfway between North (000°) and East (090°), so it’s Northeast.\n\nIf you walk on a bearing of 045° for 3 km, how far East and North have you traveled?\n\nSolution: Using trigonometry: - East component = 3 × sin(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km - North component = 3 × cos(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km"

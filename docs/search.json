Find the equation of the line perpendicular to \\(L\\) that passes through the point (8, 5).\nSolution:\nStep 1: Identify the gradient of \\(L\\) \\[m_L = 4\\]\nStep 2: Find the gradient of the perpendicular line \\[m_{\\perp} = -\\frac{1}{m_L} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\]\nStep 3: Use point-slope form with (8, 5) \\[y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x - 8)\\] \\[y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{4}x + 2\\] \\[y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + 7\\]\nAnswer: The equation is \\(y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + 7\\).\nCheck: Verify the product of gradients equals -1: \\[m_L \\times m_{\\perp} = 4 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -1\\] ✓\n\n\nProblem 6: Geometric Problem\nPoints A(2, 3), B(6, 1), and C(4, 5) form a triangle. Show that angle ABC is a right angle.\nSolution:\nTo show angle ABC is a right angle, we need to prove that lines BA and BC are perpendicular.\nStep 1: Find the gradient of BA \\[m_{BA} = \\frac{3 - 1}{2 - 6} = \\frac{2}{-4} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\]\nStep 2: Find the gradient of BC \\[m_{BC} = \\frac{5 - 1}{4 - 6} = \\frac{4}{-2} = -2\\]\nStep 3: Check if lines are perpendicular \\[m_{BA} \\times m_{BC} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times (-2) = 1\\]\nSince the product of the gradients is 1 (not -1), the lines are NOT perpendicular.\nAnswer: Angle ABC is not a right angle, as the product of gradients is 1, not -1.",

    "section": "Description of Mathematics",
    "text": "Description of Mathematics\nThis lesson investigates three mathematical concepts in the context of maps:\n\n1. Scale\nA map is a reduced version of a real landscape. Scale compares the size of lengths on a map to those in the real landscape.\nKey Concept: If a map has a scale of 1:50,000, this means that 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm (or 500 m) in real life.\n\nExample 1: Working with Scale\nA map has a scale of 1:25,000.\n\nIf two towns are 3 cm apart on the map, how far apart are they in real life?\n\nSolution: - Map distance = 3 cm - Real distance = 3 × 25,000 = 75,000 cm = 750 m = 0.75 km\n\nIf two landmarks are 2 km apart in real life, how far apart would they be on the map?\n\nSolution: - Real distance = 2 km = 200,000 cm - Map distance = 200,000 ÷ 25,000 = 8 cm\n\n\n\n2. Cartesian (Rectangular) Coordinates\nCartesian coordinates refer to the location of a specific point using a combination of horizontal distance and vertical distance.\nExample: The star below is located at (7, 4).\n[Imagine a coordinate grid with x-axis from 0 to 9 and y-axis from 0 to 6. A star is plotted at the point where x=7 and y=4.]\n\nWith Real Maps: Latitude and Longitude\n\nLongitude is the number of degrees ‘around the world’ from the Prime Meridian\nLatitude is measured in degrees north or south from the equator\n\n\n\nExample 2: Using Grid References\nOn a map with a grid system: - Location A is at grid reference (345, 678) - Location B is at grid reference (348, 682)\nIf each grid unit represents 100 meters, how far apart are A and B?\nSolution: Using the distance formula: \\[d = \\sqrt{(348-345)^2 + (682-678)^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\\] \\[d = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ grid units}\\]\nReal distance = 5 × 100 = 500 meters\n\n\n\n3. Polar Coordinates (Bearings)\nPolar coordinates specify a location using the angle or bearing from a given point and the distance from that point.\nBearings are measured clockwise from North and are written as three-digit numbers: - North = 000° (or 360°) - East = 090° - South = 180° - West = 270°\n\nExample 3: Using Bearings\nFrom point A, a landmark is located on a bearing of 045° at a distance of 3 km.\n\nIn which general direction is the landmark?\n\nSolution: 045° is halfway between North (000°) and East (090°), so it’s Northeast.\n\nIf you walk on a bearing of 045° for 3 km, how far East and North have you traveled?\n\nSolution: Using trigonometry: - East component = 3 × sin(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km - North component = 3 × cos(45°) = 3 × 0.707 ≈ 2.12 km",

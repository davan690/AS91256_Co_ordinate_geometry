## About This Course

This website contains resources and content for teaching co-ordinate geometry at Year 11 level. The course is designed as a three-week programme of study leading to assessment under the NCEA Level 2 standard AS91256, worth two credits.

## Course Overview

Co-ordinate geometry (also known as analytic geometry) combines algebra and geometry using a coordinate system. Students will learn to:

- Plot and identify points in the Cartesian plane
- Calculate distances between points
- Find midpoints of line segments
- Determine gradients (slopes) of lines
- Work with equations of lines
- Solve problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines

## Course Structure

### Week 1: Fundamentals

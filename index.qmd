## Course Overview

Co-ordinate geometry (also known as analytic geometry) combines algebra and geometry using a coordinate system. Students will learn to:

- Plot and identify points in the Cartesian plane
- Calculate distances between points
- Find midpoints of line segments
- Determine gradients (slopes) of lines
- Work with equations of lines
- Solve problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice regularly**: Mathematics improves with consistent practice
2. **Show all your working**: Marks are awarded for process, not just answers
3. **Check your answers**: Use multiple methods to verify solutions
4. **Draw diagrams**: Visualize problems on graph paper
5. **Learn from mistakes**: Review incorrect answers to understand where you went wrong
6. **Ask questions**: If you're unsure, ask your teacher or classmates
7. **Use online resources**: Khan Academy, Desmos, and other tools available in [References](resources/references.qmd)

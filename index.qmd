## About This Course

This website contains resources and content for teaching co-ordinate geometry at Year 11 level. The course is designed as a three-week programme of study leading to assessment under the NCEA Level 2 standard AS91256, worth two credits.

### Lesson Schedule

| Week | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Introduction to Cartesian plane & plotting points | Distance formula introduction | Distance formula applications | Midpoint formula | Distance & midpoint practice |
| **Week 2** | Gradient introduction & calculation | Gradient applications | Equations of lines (y = mx + c) | Parallel lines | Perpendicular lines |
| **Week 3** | Real-world applications | Problem-solving strategies | Practice assessment tasks | Review & consolidation | Assessment preparation |


## Course Overview

Co-ordinate geometry (also known as analytic geometry) combines algebra and geometry using a coordinate system. Students will learn to:

- Plot and identify points in the Cartesian plane
- Calculate distances between points
- Find midpoints of line segments
- Determine gradients (slopes) of lines
- Work with equations of lines
- Solve problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines

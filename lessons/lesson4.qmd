---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Apply the midpoint formula to find the center point of a line segment
- Understand midpoint as the average of coordinates
- Use midpoints to solve geometric problems
- Find unknown endpoints when given a midpoint
- Apply midpoint concepts to real-world situations

## Introduction

The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides it into two equal parts - exactly halfway between the two endpoints. This concept is crucial in many applications: finding the center of a bridge, determining meeting points, locating optimal facility placements, and solving geometric problems.

## The Midpoint Formula

For a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the midpoint M is:

$$ M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) $$

### Understanding the Formula

The midpoint formula simply takes the **average** of the x-coordinates and the **average** of the y-coordinates:
- Midpoint x-coordinate: $\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}$
- Midpoint y-coordinate: $\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$

Think of it as finding the "balance point" between two locations.

## Basic Examples

### Example 1: Simple Midpoint Calculation

Find the midpoint of the line segment joining A(2, 3) and B(8, 7).

**Solution:**
$$ M = \left(\frac{2 + 8}{2}, \frac{3 + 7}{2}\right) $$
$$ M = \left(\frac{10}{2}, \frac{10}{2}\right) $$
$$ M = (5, 5) $$

The midpoint is at (5, 5).

### Example 2: Midpoint with Negative Coordinates

Find the midpoint of the line segment joining P(-4, 6) and Q(2, -2).

**Solution:**
$$ M = \left(\frac{-4 + 2}{2}, \frac{6 + (-2)}{2}\right) $$
$$ M = \left(\frac{-2}{2}, \frac{4}{2}\right) $$
$$ M = (-1, 2) $$

### Example 3: Midpoint with the Origin

Find the midpoint of the line segment joining O(0, 0) and R(10, 6).

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{0 + 10}{2}, \frac{0 + 6}{2}\right)$$
$$M = (5, 3)$$

**Note:** The midpoint between the origin and any point $(a, b)$ is $\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$.

### Example 4: Midpoint with Fractional Coordinates

Find the midpoint of S(1.5, 2.5) and T(4.5, 6.5).

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{1.5 + 4.5}{2}, \frac{2.5 + 6.5}{2}\right)$$
$$M = \left(\frac{6}{2}, \frac{9}{2}\right)$$
$$M = (3, 4.5)$$

## Real-World Applications

### Example 5: Meeting Point

Two friends live at coordinates A(2, 8) and B(10, 4). They want to meet exactly halfway between their houses. Where should they meet?

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{2 + 10}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2}\right) = (6, 6)$$

They should meet at location (6, 6).

### Example 6: Facility Placement

A straight road connects town A at coordinates (10, 20) to town B at coordinates (50, 60). The council wants to place a rest stop at the midpoint. What are the coordinates?

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{10 + 50}{2}, \frac{20 + 60}{2}\right) = (30, 40)$$

The rest stop should be built at (30, 40).

### Example 7: Bridge Center Point

A bridge spans across a river from point P(-12, 5) to point Q(8, 15). Engineers need to place a support at the center of the bridge. What are its coordinates?

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{-12 + 8}{2}, \frac{5 + 15}{2}\right)$$
$$M = \left(\frac{-4}{2}, \frac{20}{2}\right)$$
$$M = (-2, 10)$$

The support should be at (-2, 10).

### Example 8: Emergency Services

An ambulance station needs to be equidistant from two hospitals:
- Hospital A: (5, 12)
- Hospital B: (15, 8)

Where should the station be located to be exactly halfway between them?

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{5 + 15}{2}, \frac{12 + 8}{2}\right) = (10, 10)$$

The station should be at (10, 10).

## Working Backwards: Finding Unknown Endpoints

Sometimes we know the midpoint and one endpoint, and need to find the other endpoint.

### Example 9: Finding the Other Endpoint

The midpoint of segment AB is M(5, 7). If point A is at (2, 3), find the coordinates of point B.

**Solution:**

Let B = $(x, y)$

Using the midpoint formula:
$$\frac{2 + x}{2} = 5 \text{ and } \frac{3 + y}{2} = 7$$

Solve for x:
$$2 + x = 10$$
$$x = 8$$

Solve for y:
$$3 + y = 14$$
$$y = 11$$

Therefore, **B = (8, 11)**

**Check:** Midpoint of (2, 3) and (8, 11) = $\left(\frac{2+8}{2}, \frac{3+11}{2}\right) = (5, 7)$ ✓

### Example 10: Finding the Starting Point

A delivery driver ends their route at point E(20, 30). The midpoint of their route was at M(12, 18). Where did they start?

**Solution:**

Let the starting point be S$(x, y)$

$$\frac{x + 20}{2} = 12 \text{ and } \frac{y + 30}{2} = 18$$

Solve for x:
$$x + 20 = 24$$
$$x = 4$$

Solve for y:
$$y + 30 = 36$$
$$y = 6$$

The driver started at **(4, 6)**.

### Example 11: Symmetric Point

Point P(3, 5) is given. Find the point Q that is symmetric to P with respect to the origin (0, 0).

**Solution:**

If the origin is the midpoint between P and Q, then:

Let Q = $(x, y)$

$$\frac{3 + x}{2} = 0 \text{ and } \frac{5 + y}{2} = 0$$

$$x = -3 \text{ and } y = -5$$

Point Q is at **(-3, -5)**.

**This is reflection through the origin.**

## Multiple Midpoints

### Example 12: Trisecting a Line Segment

Points A(0, 0) and B(9, 6) are the endpoints of a segment. Find two points that divide the segment into three equal parts.

**Solution:**

First, find the midpoint M of AB:
$$M = \left(\frac{0+9}{2}, \frac{0+6}{2}\right) = (4.5, 3)$$

Now find the midpoint of AM:
$$P = \left(\frac{0+4.5}{2}, \frac{0+3}{2}\right) = (2.25, 1.5)$$

And the midpoint of MB:
$$Q = \left(\frac{4.5+9}{2}, \frac{3+6}{2}\right) = (6.75, 4.5)$$

However, this doesn't trisect. To trisect, we need:
- First point at 1/3 of the way: $(x_1 + \frac{1}{3}(x_2-x_1), y_1 + \frac{1}{3}(y_2-y_1)) = (3, 2)$
- Second point at 2/3 of the way: $(x_1 + \frac{2}{3}(x_2-x_1), y_1 + \frac{2}{3}(y_2-y_1)) = (6, 4)$

The two trisection points are **(3, 2) and (6, 4)**.

### Example 13: Median of a Triangle

A triangle has vertices at A(0, 0), B(6, 0), and C(3, 6). Find the median from vertex A to side BC.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Find the midpoint M of BC:
$$M = \left(\frac{6+3}{2}, \frac{0+6}{2}\right) = (4.5, 3)$$

Step 2: The median is the line segment from A(0, 0) to M(4.5, 3).

The median from A has endpoint at **(4.5, 3)**.

## Geometric Properties Using Midpoints

### Example 14: Proving a Parallelogram

Show that quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A(1, 2), B(5, 3), C(6, 6), and D(2, 5) is a parallelogram by showing that the diagonals bisect each other.

**Solution:**

Find the midpoint of diagonal AC:
$$M_{AC} = \left(\frac{1+6}{2}, \frac{2+6}{2}\right) = (3.5, 4)$$

Find the midpoint of diagonal BD:
$$M_{BD} = \left(\frac{5+2}{2}, \frac{3+5}{2}\right) = (3.5, 4)$$

Since both diagonals have the same midpoint, they bisect each other, proving ABCD is a **parallelogram**.

### Example 15: Finding the Center of a Circle

Three points on a circle are A(0, 4), B(4, 0), and C(0, -4). The center lies on the perpendicular bisector of any chord. Find an approximation of the center.

**Solution:**

Find midpoint of AB:
$$M_{AB} = \left(\frac{0+4}{2}, \frac{4+0}{2}\right) = (2, 2)$$

The center is somewhere on the perpendicular bisector through (2, 2).

Find midpoint of AC:
$$M_{AC} = \left(\frac{0+0}{2}, \frac{4+(-4)}{2}\right) = (0, 0)$$

This suggests the center might be near the origin. By symmetry with points A and C, the center is at **(0, 0)** and the radius is 4.

## Connection to Other Lessons

### Link to Distance Formula (Lesson 3)

The two endpoints are equidistant from the midpoint:

**Example 16:** Verify that M(4, 5) is equidistant from A(1, 2) and B(7, 8).

Distance from M to A:
$$d_{MA} = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \sqrt{9+9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$$

Distance from M to B:
$$d_{MB} = \sqrt{(7-4)^2 + (8-5)^2} = \sqrt{9+9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$$

Both distances equal $3\sqrt{2}$, confirming M is the midpoint.

### Link to Maps (Lesson 2)

**Example 17:** On a map with scale 1:10,000, two landmarks are at (240, 180) and (360, 260). Each unit represents 10 meters. Where should a information sign be placed at the midpoint?

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{240+360}{2}, \frac{180+260}{2}\right) = (300, 220)$$

The sign should be at grid position **(300, 220)**.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify perpendicular lines from their equations
- Determine if lines are perpendicular using gradients
- Find equations of perpendicular lines

## Perpendicular Lines

Two lines are **perpendicular** if they meet at a right angle (90°).

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Property of Perpendicular Lines
If two lines are perpendicular, then $m_1 \times m_2 = -1$

Or equivalently: $m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}$
:::

### Example 1: Identifying Perpendicular Lines

Are the lines $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ perpendicular?

**Solution:**
$$m_1 \times m_2 = 2 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1$$

Yes, the lines are perpendicular.

### Example 2: Finding a Perpendicular Line Equation

Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $y = 4x - 2$ that passes through the point (8, 3).

**Solution:**
- Original gradient: $m_1 = 4$
- Perpendicular gradient: $m_2 = -\frac{1}{4}$
- Using point-slope form with (8, 3):
$$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 8)$$
$$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{4}x + 2$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{4}x + 5$$

## Practice Exercises

1. Determine if these pairs of lines are perpendicular or not:
   - $y = 3x + 2$ and $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 7$
   - $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$
   - $y = 5x$ and $y = -5x + 3$

2. Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $y = \frac{1}{3}x - 1$ through point (6, 2).

3. The line $L_1$ passes through points A(1, 2) and B(5, 10). Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $L_1$ through D(3, 4).

## Worksheet 3B: Perpendicular Lines Practice

1. Determine whether each pair of lines is perpendicular or not:
   - $y = 2x + 5$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$
   - $y = 3x - 1$ and $y = 2x + 4$

2. Find the equation of:
   - The line perpendicular to $y = -3x + 1$ through point (6, 4)
   - The line perpendicular to $y = 5x + 2$ through point (2, 3)

3. Challenge problems:
   - Line L passes through A(1, 2) and B(7, 8). Find the equation of the line perpendicular to L that passes through the midpoint of AB.
   - Points P(2, 3), Q(6, 5), and R(x, y) form a right angle at Q. If the line PQ has gradient $\frac{1}{2}$, find the gradient of QR.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

When working with perpendicular lines:

1. Identify or calculate the gradient of the given line
2. Find the negative reciprocal gradient
3. Use the point-slope form with the given point
4. Simplify to the required form

## Real-World Applications

- Architecture: Ensuring walls meet at right angles
- Navigation: Plotting perpendicular courses
- Engineering: Designing right-angle joins

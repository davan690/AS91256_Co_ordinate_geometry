---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Calculate the gradient (slope) of a line between two points
- Understand the meaning of positive, negative, zero, and undefined gradients
- Write equations of lines in various forms
- Convert between different forms of linear equations

## Gradient (Slope) of a Line

The gradient m of a line passing through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$$

### Interpreting Gradient

- **Positive gradient**: Line slopes upward from left to right
- **Negative gradient**: Line slopes downward from left to right
- **Zero gradient**: Horizontal line
- **Undefined gradient**: Vertical line

### Example 1: Calculating Gradient

Find the gradient of the line passing through A(1, 2) and B(5, 10).

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$$

## Equations of Lines

### Slope-Intercept Form
$$y = mx + c$$
where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept.

### Point-Slope Form
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
where m is the gradient and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line.

### General Form
$$ax + by + c = 0$$

### Example 2: Writing Line Equations

Write the equation of the line with gradient 3 passing through the point (2, 5).

**Solution using point-slope form:**
$$y - 5 = 3(x - 2)$$
$$y - 5 = 3x - 6$$
$$y = 3x - 1$$

### Example 3: Finding Equation from Two Points

Find the equation of the line passing through P(1, 3) and Q(4, 9).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Find the gradient
$$m = \frac{9 - 3}{4 - 1} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$$

Step 2: Use point-slope form with point P(1, 3)
$$y - 3 = 2(x - 1)$$
$$y - 3 = 2x - 2$$
$$y = 2x + 1$$

## Practice Exercises

1. Find the gradient of the line through:
   - A(2, 3) and B(6, 11)
   - C(-1, 5) and D(3, -3)

2. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient 4 and y-intercept -2
   - Through point (3, 7) with gradient -1
   - Through points (0, 2) and (5, 12)

3. Convert the equation $2x + 3y - 6 = 0$ to slope-intercept form.

## Worksheet 2: Gradient and Equations Practice

1. Find the gradient of the line through:
   - P(1, 3) and Q(5, 11)
   - R(-2, 4) and S(6, -4)
   - T(0, -3) and U(4, 5)

2. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient 3 and y-intercept 5
   - With gradient -2 passing through (4, 1)
   - Through points (2, 3) and (6, 11)

3. Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$):
   - $3x + y - 6 = 0$
   - $2x - 4y + 8 = 0$
   - $x + 2y - 10 = 0$

## Real-World Application

The gradient represents a rate of change. For example:
- In a distance-time graph, gradient represents speed
- In a cost-quantity graph, gradient represents unit price

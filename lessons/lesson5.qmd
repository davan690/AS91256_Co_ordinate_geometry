title: "Lesson 5: Gradient Basics (Rise/Run)"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Describe gradient as a rate of change using rise and run
- Identify positive, negative, zero, and undefined gradients
- Estimate gradient from a graph using grid squares

## What Is Gradient?

Gradient describes how steep a line is. It compares the vertical change (**rise**) to the horizontal change (**run**).

$$\text{gradient} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$$

### Interpreting Gradient

- **Positive gradient**: Line slopes upward from left to right
- **Negative gradient**: Line slopes downward from left to right
- **Zero gradient**: Horizontal line
- **Undefined gradient**: Vertical line

### Example 1: Rise/Run on a Grid

A line goes up 3 squares and right 6 squares.

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

### Example 2: Negative Gradient

A line goes down 4 squares and right 2 squares.

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$$

### Example 3: Zero and Undefined Gradient

- A horizontal line has $m = 0$.
- A vertical line has an undefined gradient.

## Practice Exercises

1. Use rise/run to find the gradient:
   - Up 2, right 5
   - Down 6, right 3
   - Up 0, right 4

2. State whether the gradient is positive, negative, zero, or undefined:
   - A line sloping down left to right
   - A horizontal line
   - A vertical line

3. A line rises 8 and runs 2. What is the gradient?

## Real-World Application

Gradient represents a rate of change. For example:
- In a distance-time graph, gradient represents speed.
- In a cost-quantity graph, gradient represents unit price.

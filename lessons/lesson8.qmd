title: "Lesson 8: Parallel Lines"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify parallel lines from their equations
- Determine if lines are parallel using gradients
- Find equations of parallel lines

## Parallel Lines

Two lines are **parallel** if they have the same gradient and never intersect.

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Property of Parallel Lines
If two lines are parallel, then $m_1 = m_2$
:::

### Example 1: Identifying Parallel Lines

Are the lines $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = 2x - 5$ parallel?

**Solution:**
Both lines have gradient $m = 2$, so they are parallel.

### Example 2: Finding Parallel Line Equation

Find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 3x + 1$ that passes through the point (2, 7).

**Solution:**
- Parallel lines have the same gradient: $m = 3$
- Using point-slope form with (2, 7):
$$y - 7 = 3(x - 2)$$
$$y - 7 = 3x - 6$$
$$y = 3x + 1$$

**Verification:** When $x = 2$, $y = 3(2) + 1 = 7$ ✓

## Practice Exercises

1. Determine if these pairs of lines are parallel or not:
   - $y = 3x + 2$ and $y = 3x - 7$
   - $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$
   - $y = 5x$ and $y = -5x + 3$

2. Find the equation of the line parallel to $y = -2x + 3$ through point (1, 5).

3. The line $L_1$ passes through points A(1, 2) and B(5, 10). Find the equation of the line parallel to $L_1$ through C(0, 0).

## Worksheet 3A: Parallel Lines Practice

1. Determine whether each pair of lines is parallel or not:
   - $y = 4x + 1$ and $y = 4x - 3$
   - $y = 2x + 5$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$

2. Find the equation of:
   - The line parallel to $y = 5x + 2$ through point (2, 3)
   - The line parallel to $2x + y - 4 = 0$ through point (-1, 5)

## Problem-Solving Strategy

When working with parallel lines:

1. Identify or calculate the gradient of the given line
2. Use the same gradient for the parallel line
3. Use the point-slope form with the given point
4. Simplify to the required form

## Real-World Applications

- Engineering: Designing parallel roads or railway tracks
- Architecture: Laying out evenly spaced features

## Introduction

One of the most important applications of coordinate geometry is finding the distance between two points. Whether you're calculating how far apart two cities are on a map, finding the straight-line distance a delivery drone needs to travel, or determining if two locations are within wireless signal range, the distance formula is essential.

## The Pythagorean Theorem Review

Before we explore the distance formula, let's recall the Pythagorean theorem:

For a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse of length $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

**Example:** If a right triangle has legs of 3 and 4 units, find the hypotenuse.

$$c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$$
$$c = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

## Deriving the Distance Formula

When we plot two points on a coordinate plane, we can create a right triangle:

Consider points A$(x_1, y_1)$ and B$(x_2, y_2)$:
- The horizontal leg has length $|x_2 - x_1|$
- The vertical leg has length $|y_2 - y_1|$
- The distance between A and B is the hypotenuse

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$

Taking the square root of both sides:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

This is the **distance formula**.

## Using the Distance Formula

### Example 1: Basic Distance Calculation

Find the distance between points A(1, 2) and B(4, 6).

**Solution:**
Identify the coordinates: $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 6)$

$$d = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{9 + 16}$$
$$d = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

The distance is exactly 5 units.

### Example 2: Distance with Negative Coordinates

Find the distance between C(-2, 3) and D(4, -1).

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(4-(-2))^2 + (-1-3)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{(4+2)^2 + (-4)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{6^2 + 16}$$
$$d = \sqrt{36 + 16}$$
$$d = \sqrt{52}$$

To simplify: $\sqrt{52} = \sqrt{4 \times 13} = 2\sqrt{13}$

Approximately: $d \approx 7.21$ units

### Example 3: Points on the Same Horizontal or Vertical Line

Find the distance between E(2, 5) and F(2, 9).

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (9-5)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{0 + 4^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{16} = 4$$

**Note:** When points share the same x-coordinate (vertical line) or y-coordinate (horizontal line), the distance is simply the difference in the other coordinate.

### Example 4: Distance from the Origin

Find the distance from the origin O(0, 0) to point P(6, 8).

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (8-0)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{36 + 64}$$
$$d = \sqrt{100} = 10$$

The distance from the origin to any point $(x, y)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

## Simplifying Radicals

When the distance is not a perfect square, we should simplify:

### Example 5: Simplifying Radical Answers

Find the distance between G(-1, 2) and H(5, 4), leaving your answer in simplest radical form.

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(5-(-1))^2 + (4-2)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{6^2 + 2^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{36 + 4}$$
$$d = \sqrt{40}$$

Factor out perfect squares: $\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10}$

**Decimal approximation:** $d \approx 6.32$ units

## Real-World Applications

### Example 6: Map Distances

A park ranger at point P(2, 5) needs to reach a hiker in distress at point H(8, 13). Each coordinate unit represents 100 meters. How far must the ranger travel in a straight line?

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(8-2)^2 + (13-5)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{36 + 64}$$
$$d = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ units}$$

Real distance = 10 × 100 = **1000 meters = 1 km**

### Example 7: Cell Tower Coverage

A cell tower is located at coordinates (3, 4) and has a signal range of 10 km. A house is located at (11, 10). Is the house within range? (Units are in kilometers)

**Solution:**
Distance from tower to house:
$$d = \sqrt{(11-3)^2 + (10-4)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{64 + 36}$$
$$d = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ km}$$

The house is **exactly** at the edge of the signal range (10 km).

### Example 8: Comparing Distances

A delivery company needs to determine which warehouse is closer to a customer.
- Warehouse A is at (2, 3)
- Warehouse B is at (-1, 7)
- Customer is at (5, 6)

Which warehouse should make the delivery?

**Solution:**

Distance from A to Customer:
$$d_A = \sqrt{(5-2)^2 + (6-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \approx 4.24$$

Distance from B to Customer:
$$d_B = \sqrt{(5-(-1))^2 + (6-7)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1} = \sqrt{37} \approx 6.08$$

**Warehouse A** is closer (4.24 units vs 6.08 units).

## Working Backwards: Finding Unknown Coordinates

### Example 9: Finding an Unknown x-coordinate

Point A is at (3, 4) and point B is at (x, 10). The distance between them is 10 units. Find all possible values of x.

**Solution:**
$$10 = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (10-4)^2}$$
$$10 = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 + 36}$$

Square both sides:
$$100 = (x-3)^2 + 36$$
$$(x-3)^2 = 64$$
$$x - 3 = \pm 8$$

Therefore: $x = 3 + 8 = 11$ or $x = 3 - 8 = -5$

**Answer:** B could be at (11, 10) or (-5, 10).

### Example 10: Finding an Unknown y-coordinate

Points P(2, y) and Q(6, 3) are 5 units apart. Find y.

**Solution:**
$$5 = \sqrt{(6-2)^2 + (3-y)^2}$$
$$5 = \sqrt{16 + (3-y)^2}$$
$$25 = 16 + (3-y)^2$$
$$(3-y)^2 = 9$$
$$3 - y = \pm 3$$

Therefore: $y = 3 - 3 = 0$ or $y = 3 + 3 = 6$

**Answer:** P could be at (2, 0) or (2, 6).

## Connection to Lesson 2: Maps and Scale

Remember from Lesson 2 that maps use scales. When using the distance formula with map coordinates, don't forget to convert to real distances:

**Example 11:** On a map with scale 1:50,000, two landmarks are at grid coordinates (120, 80) and (180, 140). Each grid unit represents 1 meter. What is the real distance between the landmarks?

**Solution:**
Map distance (in grid units):
$$d = \sqrt{(180-120)^2 + (140-80)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{60^2 + 60^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{3600 + 3600}$$
$$d = \sqrt{7200} = 60\sqrt{2} \approx 84.85 \text{ grid units}$$

Since each unit = 1 meter, map distance = 84.85 m

Real distance = 84.85 m × scale = 84.85 × 1 = 84.85 m (the scale tells us about map:real ratio, but here we're working with grid units that are already scaled)

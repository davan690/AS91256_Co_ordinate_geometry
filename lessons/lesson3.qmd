---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify parallel and perpendicular lines from their equations
- Determine if lines are parallel or perpendicular using gradients
- Find equations of parallel and perpendicular lines
- Solve geometric problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines

## Parallel Lines

Two lines are **parallel** if they have the same gradient and never intersect.

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Property of Parallel Lines
If two lines are parallel, then $m_1 = m_2$
:::

### Example 1: Identifying Parallel Lines

Are the lines $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = 2x - 5$ parallel?

**Solution:**
Both lines have gradient $m = 2$, so they are parallel.

### Example 2: Finding Parallel Line Equation

Find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 3x + 1$ that passes through the point (2, 7).

**Solution:**
- Parallel lines have the same gradient: $m = 3$
- Using point-slope form with (2, 7):
$$y - 7 = 3(x - 2)$$
$$y - 7 = 3x - 6$$
$$y = 3x + 1$$

Wait, this is the same line! Let me recalculate:
$$y - 7 = 3(x - 2)$$
$$y = 3x - 6 + 7$$
$$y = 3x + 1$$

Actually, checking: when $x = 2$, $y = 3(2) + 1 = 7$ ✓

The line is $y = 3x + 1$.

## Perpendicular Lines

Two lines are **perpendicular** if they meet at a right angle (90°).

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Property of Perpendicular Lines
If two lines are perpendicular, then $m_1 \times m_2 = -1$

Or equivalently: $m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}$
:::

### Example 3: Identifying Perpendicular Lines

Are the lines $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ perpendicular?

**Solution:**
$$m_1 \times m_2 = 2 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1$$

Yes, the lines are perpendicular.

### Example 4: Finding Perpendicular Line Equation

Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $y = 4x - 2$ that passes through the point (8, 3).

**Solution:**
- Original gradient: $m_1 = 4$
- Perpendicular gradient: $m_2 = -\frac{1}{4}$
- Using point-slope form with (8, 3):
$$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 8)$$
$$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{4}x + 2$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{4}x + 5$$

## Practice Exercises

1. Determine if these pairs of lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither:
   - $y = 3x + 2$ and $y = 3x - 7$
   - $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$
   - $y = 5x$ and $y = -5x + 3$

2. Find the equation of the line:
   - Parallel to $y = -2x + 3$ through point (1, 5)
   - Perpendicular to $y = \frac{1}{3}x - 1$ through point (6, 2)

3. The line $L_1$ passes through points A(1, 2) and B(5, 10).
   - Find the equation of $L_1$
   - Find the equation of the line parallel to $L_1$ through C(0, 0)
   - Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $L_1$ through D(3, 4)

## Problem-Solving Strategy

When working with parallel and perpendicular lines:

1. Identify or calculate the gradient of the given line
2. Determine the gradient of the required line (same for parallel, negative reciprocal for perpendicular)
3. Use the point-slope form with the given point
4. Simplify to the required form

## Real-World Applications

- Architecture: Ensuring walls are perpendicular to the floor
- Navigation: Plotting perpendicular courses
- Engineering: Designing parallel roads or railway tracks

title: "Lesson 1: Introduction to Cartesian Coordinates"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand the structure of the Cartesian coordinate system
- Plot points accurately on a coordinate plane
- Identify quadrants and understand positive/negative coordinates
- Recognize points that lie on axes
- Interpret coordinates from a diagram and a table

## The Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system uses two perpendicular number lines:
- The **x-axis** (horizontal)
- The **y-axis** (vertical)

The point where they intersect is called the **origin**, denoted as (0, 0).

## Plotting Points

Each point in the plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y):
- The first number (x) tells us how far to move horizontally
- The second number (y) tells us how far to move vertically

### Example 1: Plotting Points

Plot the following points:
- A(2, 3)
- B(-1, 4)
- C(-3, -2)
- D(4, -1)

### Example 2: Mixed Point Types

Plot each point and label it clearly:

- E(0, 4)
- F(5, 0)
- G(-6, 0)
- H(0, -3)
- I(2, -5)
- J(-4, 3)

**Note:** Points with $x = 0$ lie on the **y-axis**. Points with $y = 0$ lie on the **x-axis**.

## Quadrants

The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants:
- **Quadrant I:** x > 0, y > 0 (top right)
- **Quadrant II:** x < 0, y > 0 (top left)
- **Quadrant III:** x < 0, y < 0 (bottom left)
- **Quadrant IV:** x > 0, y < 0 (bottom right)

### Example 2: Identifying Quadrants

In which quadrant does each point lie?
- P(3, 5) → Quadrant I (both positive)
- Q(-2, 7) → Quadrant II (x negative, y positive)
- R(-4, -3) → Quadrant III (both negative)
- S(6, -2) → Quadrant IV (x positive, y negative)

Points on the axes are not in any quadrant.

### Example 3: Quadrant and Axis Check

For each point, state the quadrant or axis:

- U(0, 7)
- V(-8, 0)
- W(-2, 5)
- X(6, -1)
- Y(3, 0)
- Z(0, -6)

## Practice Exercises

1. Plot the following points on a coordinate plane:
   - P(3, -2)
   - Q(-4, 1)
   - R(0, 5)
   - S(-2, -3)
   - T(4, 0)
   - U(-6, 2)
   - V(5, -4)

2. Identify the quadrant or axis for each point:
   - A(5, 7)
   - B(-3, 2)
   - C(-1, -6)
   - D(4, -3)
   - E(0, -8)
   - F(9, 0)

3. Complete the table:

| Point | $x$ value | $y$ value | Quadrant/Axis |
|---|---|---|---|
| G(2, 6) |  |  |  |
| H(-5, 4) |  |  |  |
| I(0, -3) |  |  |  |
| J(-7, 0) |  |  |  |
| K(-2, -5) |  |  |  |

4. Name three points that lie:
   - In Quadrant II
   - On the x-axis
   - On the y-axis

5. Create your own set of four points, one in each quadrant, and swap with a classmate to plot and check.

## Exit Ticket

1. Plot and label: A(4, -2), B(-3, -1), C(0, 6).
2. State the quadrant or axis for each point above.
3. Write one coordinate that lies in Quadrant III and one that lies on the y-axis.

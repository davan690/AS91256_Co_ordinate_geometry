## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand the structure of the Cartesian coordinate system
- Plot points accurately on a coordinate plane
- Calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula
- Find the midpoint of a line segment

## The Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system uses two perpendicular number lines:
- The **x-axis** (horizontal)
- The **y-axis** (vertical)

The point where they intersect is called the **origin**, denoted as (0, 0).

## Plotting Points

Each point in the plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y):
- The first number (x) tells us how far to move horizontally
- The second number (y) tells us how far to move vertically

### Example 1: Plotting Points

Plot the following points:
- A(2, 3)
- B(-1, 4)
- C(-3, -2)
- D(4, -1)

## Distance Formula

The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

### Example 2: Finding Distance

Find the distance between points A(1, 2) and B(4, 6).

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{9 + 16}$$
$$d = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

## Midpoint Formula

The midpoint M of a line segment joining $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:

$$M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$

### Example 3: Finding Midpoint

Find the midpoint of the line segment joining A(2, 3) and B(8, 7).

**Solution:**
$$M = \left(\frac{2 + 8}{2}, \frac{3 + 7}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{2}, \frac{10}{2}\right) = (5, 5)$$

## Practice Exercises

1. Plot the following points on a coordinate plane:
   - P(3, -2)
   - Q(-4, 1)
   - R(0, 5)

2. Find the distance between:
   - C(0, 0) and D(3, 4)
   - E(-1, 2) and F(5, 10)

3. Find the midpoint of the line segment joining:
   - G(1, 1) and H(7, 9)
   - J(-2, 3) and K(4, -5)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand the structure of the Cartesian coordinate system
- Plot points accurately on a coordinate plane
- Identify quadrants and understand positive/negative coordinates

## The Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system uses two perpendicular number lines:
- The **x-axis** (horizontal)
- The **y-axis** (vertical)

The point where they intersect is called the **origin**, denoted as (0, 0).

## Plotting Points

Each point in the plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y):
- The first number (x) tells us how far to move horizontally
- The second number (y) tells us how far to move vertically

### Example 1: Plotting Points

Plot the following points:
- A(2, 3)
- B(-1, 4)
- C(-3, -2)
- D(4, -1)

## Quadrants

The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants:
- **Quadrant I:** x > 0, y > 0 (top right)
- **Quadrant II:** x < 0, y > 0 (top left)
- **Quadrant III:** x < 0, y < 0 (bottom left)
- **Quadrant IV:** x > 0, y < 0 (bottom right)

### Example 2: Identifying Quadrants

In which quadrant does each point lie?
- P(3, 5) → Quadrant I (both positive)
- Q(-2, 7) → Quadrant II (x negative, y positive)
- R(-4, -3) → Quadrant III (both negative)
- S(6, -2) → Quadrant IV (x positive, y negative)

Points on the axes are not in any quadrant.

## Practice Exercises

1. Plot the following points on a coordinate plane:
   - P(3, -2)
   - Q(-4, 1)
   - R(0, 5)
   - S(-2, -3)
   - T(4, 0)

2. Identify the quadrant for each point:
   - A(5, 7)
   - B(-3, 2)
   - C(-1, -6)
   - D(4, -3)

3. Name three points that lie:
   - In Quadrant II
   - On the x-axis
   - On the y-axis

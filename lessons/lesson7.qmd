---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Write equations of lines in slope-intercept and point-slope forms
- Convert between equation forms
- Find the intersection point of two lines

## Equations of Lines

### Slope-Intercept Form

$$y = mx + c$$

### Point-Slope Form

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

### General Form

$$ax + by + c = 0$$

### Example 1: Equation from Gradient and Point

Write the equation of the line with gradient 3 passing through (2, 5).

**Solution:**
$$y - 5 = 3(x - 2)$$
$$y - 5 = 3x - 6$$
$$y = 3x - 1$$

### Example 2: Equation from Two Points

Find the equation of the line through P(1, 3) and Q(4, 9).

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{9 - 3}{4 - 1} = 2$$
$$y - 3 = 2(x - 1)$$
$$y = 2x + 1$$

## Intersection of Two Lines

The intersection point solves both equations at the same time.

### Example 3: Intersection by Substitution

Find the intersection of:

$$y = 2x + 1$$
$$y = -x + 7$$

**Solution:**
Set them equal:
$$2x + 1 = -x + 7$$
$$3x = 6$$
$$x = 2$$
Substitute back:
$$y = 2(2) + 1 = 5$$

Intersection is $(2, 5)$.

### Example 4: Intersection with General Form

Find the intersection of:

$$2x + y - 8 = 0$$
$$x - y + 1 = 0$$

**Solution:**
From the second equation: $y = x + 1$.
Substitute into the first:
$$2x + (x + 1) - 8 = 0$$
$$3x - 7 = 0$$
$$x = \frac{7}{3}$$
Then $y = \frac{7}{3} + 1 = \frac{10}{3}$.

Intersection is $\left(\frac{7}{3}, \frac{10}{3}\right)$.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient -2 and y-intercept 5
   - Through point (3, 7) with gradient -1
   - Through points (0, 2) and (5, 12)

2. Convert to slope-intercept form:
   - $3x + y - 6 = 0$
   - $2x - 4y + 8 = 0$

3. Find the intersection point of each pair:
   - $y = x + 3$ and $y = -2x + 9$
   - $y = 4x - 5$ and $2x + y = 7$

## Worksheet 2B: Linear Equations and Intersections

1. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient 3 and y-intercept 5
   - With gradient -2 passing through (4, 1)
   - Through points (2, 3) and (6, 11)

2. Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$):
   - $x + 2y - 10 = 0$
   - $4x - 2y + 6 = 0$

3. Find the intersection point:
   - $y = 2x - 1$ and $y = -x + 8$
   - $3x + y = 12$ and $x - y = 4$

title: "Lesson 6: Gradient Using the Formula"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Calculate the gradient of a line between two points using the formula
- Interpret the meaning of positive, negative, zero, and undefined gradients
- Check gradient calculations for reasonableness

## The Gradient Formula

For two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

This compares the vertical change to the horizontal change.

### Example 1: Gradient from Two Points

Find the gradient of the line through A(1, 2) and B(5, 10).

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$$

### Example 2: Negative Gradient

Find the gradient of the line through C(-1, 5) and D(3, -3).

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{-3 - 5}{3 - (-1)} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2$$

### Example 3: Zero or Undefined

- If $y_1 = y_2$, then $m = 0$ (horizontal line).
- If $x_1 = x_2$, the gradient is undefined (vertical line).

## Practice Exercises

1. Find the gradient of the line through:
   - E(2, 3) and F(6, 11)
   - G(-4, 1) and H(2, -5)
   - I(0, 4) and J(5, 4)

2. Decide if the gradient is positive, negative, zero, or undefined:
   - K(3, -1) and L(3, 6)
   - M(-2, 4) and N(4, 4)

3. A line has gradient $-\frac{3}{2}$ and passes through (2, 1). Choose another point on the line.

## Real-World Application

Gradient represents a rate of change. For example, a road that rises 1 meter for every 5 meters run has gradient $\frac{1}{5}$.

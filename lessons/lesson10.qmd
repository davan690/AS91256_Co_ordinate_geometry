title: "Lesson 10: Equation of a Line from Gradient and a Point"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Use point-slope form to write an equation from a gradient and a point
- Convert equations to slope-intercept form
- Check whether a point lies on a line

## Point-Slope Form

If a line has gradient $m$ and passes through $(x_1, y_1)$, then:

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

### Example 1: Write an Equation from a Gradient and a Point

Find the equation of the line with gradient 4 passing through (2, -1).

**Solution:**
$$y - (-1) = 4(x - 2)$$
$$y + 1 = 4x - 8$$
$$y = 4x - 9$$

### Example 2: Keep in Point-Slope Form

Find the equation of the line with gradient $-\frac{3}{2}$ passing through (6, 5).

**Solution:**
$$y - 5 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 6)$$

### Example 3: Check a Point

Does (3, 7) lie on the line $y = 2x + 1$?

**Solution:**
$$2(3) + 1 = 7$$
Yes, the point lies on the line.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write the equation of the line with gradient 3 passing through (-1, 4).
2. Write the equation of the line with gradient $-2$ passing through (5, 9).
3. Convert your equations from (1) and (2) to slope-intercept form.
4. Determine whether (4, -3) lies on the line $y = -x + 1$.

## Worksheet 2C: Gradient and a Point

1. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient 2 passing through (1, -3)
   - With gradient $-\frac{1}{2}$ passing through (6, 4)

2. Convert to slope-intercept form:
   - $y - 7 = 5(x + 1)$
   - $y + 2 = -3(x - 4)$

3. Check whether each point lies on the line $y = 3x - 2$:
   - (1, 1)
   - (2, 4)

## Worksheet 2C Answers

1. $y = 2x - 5$, $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 7$
2. $y = 5x + 12$, $y = -3x + 10$
3. Yes, yes

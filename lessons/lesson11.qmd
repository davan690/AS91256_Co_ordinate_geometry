## Overview

Use these mixed practice sets to consolidate learning across all coordinate geometry topics. These can be used for in-class revision or homework.

## Practice Set A: Coordinates and Quadrants

1. State the quadrant or axis for each point:
   - A(3, -5)
   - B(-4, 2)
   - C(0, -7)
   - D(6, 0)
   - E(-2, -3)

## Practice Set B: Distance and Midpoint

1. Find the distance between (-1, 4) and (5, 1).
2. Find the midpoint of (-6, 2) and (4, -4).
3. Find the distance from the origin to (7, -24).

## Practice Set C: Gradients and Line Equations

1. Find the gradient of the line through (-2, 1) and (4, 7).
2. Write the equation of the line with gradient -3 passing through (2, -1).
3. Find the equation of the line through (0, -2) and (3, 4).
4. Convert $4x - 2y + 6 = 0$ to slope-intercept form.

## Practice Set D: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

1. Determine whether each pair of lines is parallel, perpendicular, or neither:
   - $y = -2x + 1$ and $y = -2x - 4$
   - $y = \frac{1}{4}x + 3$ and $y = -4x + 2$

2. Find the equation of:
   - The line perpendicular to $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 5$ through (0, 2)
   - The line parallel to $3x + y - 9 = 0$ through (1, -1)

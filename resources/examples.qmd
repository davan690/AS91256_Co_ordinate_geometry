## Comprehensive Worked Examples

This page provides detailed, step-by-step solutions to help students understand the problem-solving process.

## Example Set 1: Distance and Midpoint

### Problem 1: Distance Between Points

Find the distance between points A(3, 7) and B(15, 12).

**Solution:**

Given: $A(3, 7)$ and $B(15, 12)$

Using the distance formula:
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

Substitute the coordinates:
$$d = \sqrt{(15 - 3)^2 + (12 - 7)^2}$$

Simplify inside the square root:
$$d = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2}$$
$$d = \sqrt{144 + 25}$$
$$d = \sqrt{169}$$
$$d = 13$$

**Answer:** The distance is 13 units.

### Problem 2: Finding a Missing Coordinate

Point M is the midpoint of line segment AB, where A(-2, 5) and M(3, 4). Find the coordinates of point B.

**Solution:**

Given: $A(-2, 5)$, $M(3, 4)$, and B$(x_2, y_2)$ is unknown

Using the midpoint formula:
$$M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$

For the x-coordinate:
$$3 = \frac{-2 + x_2}{2}$$
$$6 = -2 + x_2$$
$$x_2 = 8$$

For the y-coordinate:
$$4 = \frac{5 + y_2}{2}$$
$$8 = 5 + y_2$$
$$y_2 = 3$$

**Answer:** Point B is at (8, 3).

## Example Set 2: Lines and Gradients

### Problem 3: Finding the Equation of a Line

Find the equation of the line that passes through points P(2, 5) and Q(8, 17).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Calculate the gradient
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{17 - 5}{8 - 2} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$$

Step 2: Use point-slope form with point P(2, 5)
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
$$y - 5 = 2(x - 2)$$

Step 3: Expand and simplify
$$y - 5 = 2x - 4$$
$$y = 2x + 1$$

**Answer:** The equation is $y = 2x + 1$.

**Verification:** Check both points satisfy the equation:
- For P(2, 5): $5 = 2(2) + 1 = 5$ ✓
- For Q(8, 17): $17 = 2(8) + 1 = 17$ ✓

### Problem 4: Intersection of Lines

Find the point of intersection of lines $L_1: y = 2x + 1$ and $L_2: y = -x + 7$.

**Solution:**

At the intersection point, both equations are satisfied, so:
$$2x + 1 = -x + 7$$

Solve for x:
$$2x + x = 7 - 1$$
$$3x = 6$$
$$x = 2$$

Substitute into $L_1$ to find y:
$$y = 2(2) + 1 = 5$$

**Answer:** The lines intersect at point (2, 5).

**Verification:** Check with $L_2$: $y = -(2) + 7 = 5$ ✓

## Example Set 3: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

### Problem 5: Perpendicular Line Through a Point

Line $L$ has equation $y = 4x - 3$. Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $L$ that passes through the point (8, 5).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify the gradient of $L$
$$m_L = 4$$

Step 2: Find the gradient of the perpendicular line
$$m_{\perp} = -\frac{1}{m_L} = -\frac{1}{4}$$

Step 3: Use point-slope form with (8, 5)
$$y - 5 = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 8)$$
$$y - 5 = -\frac{1}{4}x + 2$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{4}x + 7$$

**Answer:** The equation is $y = -\frac{1}{4}x + 7$.

**Check:** Verify the product of gradients equals -1:
$$m_L \times m_{\perp} = 4 \times \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) = -1$$ ✓

### Problem 6: Geometric Problem

Points A(2, 3), B(6, 1), and C(4, 5) form a triangle. Show that angle ABC is a right angle.

**Solution:**

To show angle ABC is a right angle, we need to prove that lines BA and BC are perpendicular.

Step 1: Find the gradient of BA
$$m_{BA} = \frac{3 - 1}{2 - 6} = \frac{2}{-4} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

Step 2: Find the gradient of BC
$$m_{BC} = \frac{5 - 1}{4 - 6} = \frac{4}{-2} = -2$$

Step 3: Check if lines are perpendicular
$$m_{BA} \times m_{BC} = -\frac{1}{2} \times (-2) = 1$$

Hmm, this gives 1, not -1. Let me recalculate...

Actually, I made an error. Let me recalculate the gradients more carefully:
$$m_{BA} = \frac{3 - 1}{2 - 6} = \frac{2}{-4} = -\frac{1}{2}$$
$$m_{BC} = \frac{5 - 1}{4 - 6} = \frac{4}{-2} = -2$$

Product: $(-\frac{1}{2}) \times (-2) = 1$

This means the lines are NOT perpendicular (we need product = -1), so angle ABC is NOT a right angle.

**Answer:** Angle ABC is not a right angle, as the product of gradients is 1, not -1.

## Tips for Success

1. **Always show your working** - partial credit is often awarded
2. **Check your answers** - substitute back into original equations
3. **Draw diagrams** - visual representations help understanding
4. **Use appropriate formulas** - know when to apply each formula
5. **Be careful with signs** - negative numbers need special attention

## Practice Strategy

- Work through these examples without looking at the solutions
- Compare your method with the shown solution
- If you made errors, identify where and why
- Try creating similar problems and solving them

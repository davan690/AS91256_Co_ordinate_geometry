## Study Tips & Strategies

### Recommended Study Approach

1. **Master the basics first** - Ensure you can plot points and calculate distances
2. **Practice regularly** - 15-20 minutes daily is better than cramming
3. **Check your work** - Use multiple methods to verify answers
4. **Draw diagrams** - Visualize every problem
5. **Learn from mistakes** - Review incorrect answers carefully

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Mixing up x and y coordinates
- Forgetting the square root in distance formula
- Sign errors when calculating gradient
- Not simplifying final answers
- Rushing through multi-step problems

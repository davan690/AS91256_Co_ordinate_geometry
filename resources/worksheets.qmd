## Practice Worksheets

The following worksheets provide structured practice for each topic in the course.

### Worksheet 1: Coordinate Basics

**Topic:** Plotting points, distance, and midpoint

**Exercises:**

1. Plot the following points on a coordinate plane:
   - A(4, 3), B(-2, 5), C(-3, -4), D(1, -2), E(0, 6)

2. Calculate the distance between:
   - A(1, 1) and B(4, 5)
   - C(-2, 3) and D(3, -9)
   - E(0, 0) and F(-5, 12)

3. Find the midpoint of:
   - Line segment from (2, 8) to (10, 4)
   - Line segment from (-3, 7) to (5, -1)

### Worksheet 2: Gradient and Equations

**Topic:** Finding gradients and writing equations of lines

**Exercises:**

1. Find the gradient of the line through:
   - P(1, 3) and Q(5, 11)
   - R(-2, 4) and S(6, -4)
   - T(0, -3) and U(4, 5)

2. Write the equation of the line:
   - With gradient 3 and y-intercept 5
   - With gradient -2 passing through (4, 1)
   - Through points (2, 3) and (6, 11)

3. Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$):
   - $3x + y - 6 = 0$
   - $2x - 4y + 8 = 0$
   - $x + 2y - 10 = 0$

### Worksheet 3: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

**Topic:** Working with parallel and perpendicular lines

**Exercises:**

1. Determine whether each pair of lines is parallel, perpendicular, or neither:
   - $y = 4x + 1$ and $y = 4x - 3$
   - $y = 2x + 5$ and $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$
   - $y = 3x - 1$ and $y = 2x + 4$

2. Find the equation of:
   - The line parallel to $y = 5x + 2$ through point (2, 3)
   - The line perpendicular to $y = -3x + 1$ through point (6, 4)
   - The line parallel to $2x + y - 4 = 0$ through point (-1, 5)

3. Challenge problems:
   - Line $L$ passes through A(1, 2) and B(7, 8). Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $L$ that passes through the midpoint of AB.
   - Points P(2, 3), Q(6, 5), and R(x, y) form a right angle at Q. If the line PQ has gradient $\frac{1}{2}$, find the gradient of QR.
